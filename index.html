        </h1>
        <div class="subheading mb-5">Business Administrationüìö</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Tyler Traczyk and I am a first year University of California, Riverside student from Irvine, California. I am currently taking a variety of courses required to get admitted into the School of Business and eventually a bachelor‚Äôs degree from this university. I am planning to pursue in Accounting once I am in the School of Business due to my passion for Mathematics and Writing. My most successful and passionate subjects in High School included Mathematics and English, as I knew that they were some of the most important skills I would need in my career. I hope to one day have a master‚Äôs degree in accounting and Taxation and utilize that to earn my Certified Public Accountant License. Eventually, I want to become a CFO or CEO of a company.<br><br>

        I have had various leadership positions and work experience throughout my years in high school. I have played soccer for about fourteen years of my life and I have been captain of my club and high school teams. I have had jobs in retail and in the food industry. I worked at Abercrombie and Fitch for around nine months as a retail worker. I enhanced my social skills and ability to help others. I also worked at a restaurant called Freshii for about four months where I learned to make food and account for money. In high school, I was Vice President for a club my peers and I named, One Goal, where we held events to donate sports equipment to younger generation athletes as well as those who had a passion for sports, but yet could not play due to lack of finances.  I was our High School‚Äôs ASB Vice President in my senior year, where I learned how to make critical decisions that would have a major effect on our students. Finally, I am set to becoming Vice President of UCR‚Äôs Accounting Society for next year. My passion and commitment towards Accounting is what inspired me to take up this position and I hope to benefit and learn many essential skills needed for my career.<br><br>

        I believe what separates me from other leaders is my ability to adapt to changes in a positive way and not looking at myself as above my peers when I am in a leadership position. Throughout my childhood, my father was in the military, so we moved around the world including various cities in Florida, Kansas, South Korea, and California. At the time, I did not enjoy having to make new friends, go to another school and home because I felt like the outcast. However, reflecting back on each of these experiences have made me a stronger person today. I see that many people react to change in a negative way because it makes them feel uncomfortable and unsettled. But now I am able to adapt to problems and many different kinds of situations that will come into my life. As I live by the saying, ‚ÄúExpect the unexpected.‚Äù
